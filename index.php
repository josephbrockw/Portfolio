        <h2>My Name Is Joe Wilkinson</h1>
        <p>I'm the cofounder of <a href="http://www.codetheblock.org" target="_blank">Code the Block</a>, a nonprofit focused on bringing accessible computer science education to Kansas City's urban core. As a self-taught web develper and programmer, I wanted to make sure everyone had an opportunity to be a part of an incredibly interesting and wide ranging industry. For fun, I volunteer as an assistant coach for the Hogan Prepatory Academy High School Basketball team.</p>
        <p>I enjoy trying to create new business ideas that can have a positive impact on people's daily lives. I am very ambitious and want to make an impact on a grand scale. I like to be in the company of like minded people who push me to continue to develop as a person.</p>
