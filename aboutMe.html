      <h1>Introduction.</h1>
      <p>I'm the cofounder of <a href="www.codetheblock.org">Code the Block</a>, a nonprofit focused on bringing accessible computer science education to Kansas City's urban core. As a self-taught web develper and programmer, I wanted to make sure everyone had an opportunity to be a part of an incredibly interesting and wide ranging industry. For fun, I volunteer as an assistant coach for the Hogan Prepatory Academy High School Basketball team.</p>
      <p>I enjoy trying to create new business ideas that can have a positive impact on people's daily lives. I am very ambitious and want to make an impact on a grand scale. I like to be in the company of like minded people who push me to continue to develop as a person.</p>

      <p>I was born in Chicago but raised in Kansas City. After a brief stint in Tulsa, OK for college, I moved right back to Kansas City. Like most Kansas Citians, I enjoy BBQ and sports.</p>
      <p>I have two sisters and a brother who are some of the most incredible people I know and they impress me daily.</p>
      <p>I graduated from the University of Tulsa in 2013 with degrees in Marketing, Business Mangagement specializing in Entrepreneurship and received a Certificate in Nonprofit Management.</p>
